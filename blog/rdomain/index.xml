      <description>Introduction I&amp;rsquo;ve been spending my recent time off tinkering with my neglected home network. OpenBSD has been a core feature of my home network ever since I was a student, I usually have some sort of OpenBSD server as well as an OpenBSD router. I like it&amp;rsquo;s simplicity and its stability, but most of all I appreciate OpenBSD as a learning tool. The kernel code is much easier to navigate and read than the Linux kernel, so if you&amp;rsquo;re interested in learning more about operating systems it&amp;rsquo;s a great place to start.</description>
